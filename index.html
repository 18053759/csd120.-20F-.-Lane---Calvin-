    <H1>Welcome to Calvin Lane's CSD120 Website!</H1>
    <p>
        My name is Calvin Lane, I am loving this opportunity to learn web design through programming and not a site-builder.
        <br>
        I just completed High School at Superior Heights Collegiate and Vocational School and instantly moved into college to further my skills within programming.
        <br>
        In my free time I create useless robots with arduino, play electic bass and guitar, and build/fix miscellaneous items.
        <br>
        I want to be the kind of person who can give assistance to other people when they need it and try and be as nice as possible when meeting people.
        <br>
        I aspire to do well in my classes and have a very enjoyable time in my freshman year of college!
        <br>
